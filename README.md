# Enhancing Spatial Spread Prediction of Infectious Diseases through Integrating Multi-scale Human Mobility Dynamics

This repo contains the source code and datasets for our paper "Enhancing Spatial Spread Prediction of Infectious Diseases through Integrating Multi-scale Human Mobility Dynamics"

## Dataset
You can generate the dataset by running the files in folder ``generate_dataset`` by the labeling.

## Our Model
You can make predictions with the program in folder ``prediction``.
### Pooling Module
You can use the files in the folder ``pooling`` to train the pooling module and make predictions.
### Prediciton Module
You can use the files in the ``prediction_task`` folder to train the prediction module and make predictions.
